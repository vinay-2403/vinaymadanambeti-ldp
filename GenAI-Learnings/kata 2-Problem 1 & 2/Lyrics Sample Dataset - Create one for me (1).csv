Lyrics
I wanna dance with somebody (who loves me)
"You're the one that I want, oohoo, honey"
"Baby, baby, baby, oh"
A sky full of stars and a heart full of scars
Can't stop the feeling! So excited
"Shake it off, shake it off"
I'm walking on sunshine
Don't stop believin'
Bohemian Rhapsody is the best song ever
Livin' on a prayer
"I will survive, oh as long as I know how"
"Like a prayer, like a prayer"
A little bit of Monica in my life
"Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm"
Bye Bye Bye
I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa
"It's gettin' hot in here, so take off all your clothes"
Can't feel my face when I'm with you
"Work, work, work, work, work, work"
"Hello, from the other side"
I'm gonna make you an offer you can't refuse
My heart will go on
A thousand miles from nowhere
"We are the champions, my friend"
You've got a friend in me
Hakuna Matata
Can't buy me love
I believe I can fly
"I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world"
