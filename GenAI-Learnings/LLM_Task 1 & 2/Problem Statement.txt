Task - 1 : You are given a list of integers where each number appears twice, except for one unique number that appears only once. 
Example : 
Input: [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]  
Output: 4  



Task - 2 : Create a class BankAccount that allows a user to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance. Implement encapsulation so that the balance cannot be accessed directly but only through methods.

Requirements:

deposit(amount): Adds amount to the balance.
withdraw(amount): Deducts amount from the balance if sufficient funds exist.
get_balance(): Returns the current balance.
The balance should be private and should not be directly accessible.

Example usage :

acc = BankAccount(1000)  
acc.deposit(500)  
acc.withdraw(300)  
print(acc.get_balance())  # Output: 1200  

print(acc.__balance)  # This should raise an AttributeError
